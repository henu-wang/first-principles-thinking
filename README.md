## What Is First Principles Thinking?

First principles thinking is the practice of breaking down complex problems into their most fundamental truths — the basic elements that cannot be deduced from any other proposition — and then reasoning up from there to build new solutions.

Instead of accepting conventional assumptions ("this is how it's always been done"), you ask: **"What do I know to be absolutely true?"** and build your reasoning from that foundation.

> "I think people's thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It's rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis. They'll say, 'We'll do that because it's always been done that way.' Or they'll not do it because 'Well, nobody's ever done that, so it must not be good.'" — Elon Musk

## History and Origins

### Aristotle (384-322 BC)

Aristotle defined a first principle as "the first basis from which a thing is known." In his *Metaphysics*, he argued that every field of knowledge has its own set of first principles — foundational truths that don't require proof because they are self-evident.

### Descartes (1596-1650)

René Descartes applied systematic doubt to strip away all beliefs that could possibly be false, arriving at his famous first principle: *"Cogito, ergo sum"* (I think, therefore I am). From this single undeniable truth, he attempted to rebuild all knowledge.

### Modern Era

In the 20th and 21st centuries, first principles thinking has been championed by:

| Thinker | Domain | Application |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Richard Feynman** | Physics | Stripping physics problems to fundamentals |
| **Elon Musk** | Technology/Business | Reimagining rockets, batteries, tunnels |
| **Charlie Munger** | Investing | Building a "latticework of mental models" |
| **Jeff Bezos** | Business | Working backwards from customer needs |

## The Method

### The Three-Step Process

```
Step 1: IDENTIFY your assumptions
        ↓
Step 2: BREAK DOWN the problem to fundamental truths
        ↓
Step 3: CREATE new solutions from the ground up
```

### Detailed Breakdown

#### Step 1: Identify Assumptions

List everything you believe about the problem. Be ruthlessly honest about what you're taking for granted.

**Questions to ask:**
- What do "everyone knows" about this?
- What have I been told that I haven't verified?
- What am I assuming because of past experience?
- What conventions am I following without questioning?

#### Step 2: Decompose to Fundamentals

Break each assumption down. Keep asking "Why?" and "Is this actually true?" until you reach bedrock — facts that are provably, physically, or mathematically true.

**The Five Whys technique:**
```
Assumption: "Electric cars are too expensive"
Why? → "Because batteries are expensive"
Why? → "Because battery packs cost $600/kWh"
Why? → "Because... that's the market price?"
What are batteries MADE of? → Cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, polymers
What do those COST? → About $80/kWh on commodity markets
FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH: The raw materials for batteries cost ~$80/kWh.
The gap between $80 and $600 is manufacturing, not physics.
```

#### Step 3: Reconstruct from Fundamentals

With foundational truths in hand, build new solutions unconstrained by conventional approaches.

```
Fundamental truth: Battery materials cost ~$80/kWh
New solution: Build our own battery factory, optimize manufacturing
Result: Tesla's battery costs dropped from $600/kWh to under $150/kWh
```

## First Principles vs. Reasoning by Analogy

| Aspect | First Principles | Reasoning by Analogy |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Starting point** | Fundamental truths | What others have done |
| **Process** | Decompose → Rebuild | Copy → Modify |
| **Speed** | Slower initially | Faster initially |
| **Innovation** | Breakthrough potential | Incremental improvement |
| **Risk** | Higher (uncharted territory) | Lower (proven approach) |
| **Best for** | Novel problems, broken systems | Routine decisions, time pressure |

**Important:** Analogy-based reasoning isn't bad — it's efficient for most daily decisions. First principles thinking is a tool for situations where conventional approaches have failed or where breakthrough innovation is needed.

### When to Use Each

**Use first principles when:**
- The established approach seems irrationally expensive or complex
- You're hearing "that's impossible" without a physics-based reason
- An industry hasn't changed in decades despite new technology
- You're creating something genuinely new

**Use analogy when:**
- Time is limited and the stakes are moderate
- The problem closely resembles one that's been solved before
- You need a "good enough" solution quickly
- The domain is well-understood and stable

## Real-World Applications

### Business & Startups

#### SpaceX: Rethinking Rocket Costs

**Conventional wisdom:** "Rockets cost $65 million because aerospace is expensive."

**First principles analysis:**
```
What is a rocket made of?
→ Aerospace-grade aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber
→ Raw material cost: ~2% of the rocket's price

Where does the other 98% go?
→ Low production volumes, cost-plus contracts, no reusability
→ Every rocket is hand-built and thrown away after one use

Fundamental truth: There's no physics reason a rocket can't be reused.
An airplane doesn't get thrown away after one flight.

Solution: Build reusable rockets with higher production volumes.
Result: Falcon 9 launch cost reduced from $65M to ~$27M
```

#### IKEA: Rethinking Furniture

**Conventional wisdom:** "Furniture requires skilled assembly, delivery, and showrooms."

**First principles:**
- People need functional furniture at low cost
- Flat-pack shipping is 6x cheaper than assembled shipping
- Customers can follow instructions
- A warehouse with display rooms is cheaper than traditional retail

#### Airbnb: Rethinking Accommodation

**Conventional wisdom:** "Travelers need hotels."

**First principles:**
- Travelers need a clean, safe place to sleep
- Millions of spare rooms sit empty every night
- Trust can be established through reviews and verification
- A platform connecting the two eliminates the need for hotel infrastructure

### Engineering & Product Design

**Challenge:** "Our product weighs too much for portable use."

| Analogy approach | First principles approach |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Look at competitors, copy their materials | List every component and its function |
| Make each part 10% thinner | Ask: "Does this component need to exist?" |
| Result: 15% lighter | Eliminate redundant parts, combine functions |
| | Result: 50% lighter |

### Personal Finance

**Conventional wisdom:** "You need to earn more to save more."

**First principles:**
```
Savings = Income - Expenses

Fundamental truths:
- You need shelter, food, transportation, and healthcare
- Everything else is optional
- The actual cost of necessities is much lower than most people spend

Analysis:
- Housing: Do you need THIS much space in THIS location?
- Transportation: Do you need a NEW car? Do you need a car at all?
- Food: Does nutrition require restaurants and convenience foods?

Result: Often 30-50% of spending is habit/convention, not necessity
```

### Career Decisions

**Conventional wisdom:** "Follow the career path that's been laid out."

**First principles:**
```
What do I actually want from work?
→ Income, meaning, growth, autonomy, relationships (varies by person)

What are ALL the ways to achieve those things?
→ Not limited to traditional employment paths
→ Freelancing, entrepreneurship, portfolio careers, geographic arbitrage

What skills are fundamentally valuable?
→ Problem-solving, communication, specialized knowledge
→ These transfer across industries and roles

What constraints are real vs. assumed?
→ Real: need income for living expenses
→ Assumed: must work in the same industry, must have a linear career path
```

### Education & Learning

**Conventional wisdom:** "Learning requires classrooms and degrees."

**First principles:**
- Learning requires information, practice, and feedback
- Information is available online (often free)
- Practice can happen anywhere
- Feedback can come from peers, mentors, or results
- Degrees are valuable primarily for signaling, not learning

## Step-by-Step Framework

### The First Principles Canvas

```markdown
# First Principles Analysis: [Problem Statement]

## 1. Current Assumptions
List everything "everyone knows" about this problem:
| # | Assumption | Source | Verified? |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 |           |        | Yes/No    |
| 2 |           |        | Yes/No    |
| 3 |           |        | Yes/No    |

## 2. Decomposition
For each unverified assumption, break it down:

### Assumption: [Statement]
- Why do we believe this? → [reason]
  - Why? → [deeper reason]
    - Why? → [even deeper]
      - **Fundamental truth:** [bedrock fact]

## 3. Fundamental Truths
Facts that are provably, physically, or mathematically true:
1.
2.
3.

## 4. Constraints
Which constraints are real (physics, law, math) vs. assumed (convention)?
| Constraint | Real or Assumed? | Evidence |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
|           |                 |          |

## 5. New Solutions
Build up from fundamental truths, ignoring conventional approaches:
| Solution | Based on Truth # | Feasibility | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
|         |                 |             |        |

## 6. Validation

## The Socratic Method Connection

First principles thinking is deeply connected to the Socratic method — using questions to expose contradictions and uncover truth.

### Key Socratic Questions for First Principles

| Category | Questions |
|----------|----------|
| **Clarification** | What do you mean by that? Can you give an example? |
| **Probing assumptions** | What are we assuming? Why do we believe this? What if the opposite were true? |
| **Probing evidence** | What evidence supports this? How reliable is that evidence? |
| **Considering alternatives** | What are other ways to look at this? What would [expert] say? |
| **Implications** | If that's true, what follows? What are the consequences? |
| **Meta-questions** | Why is this question important? What do we still not know? |

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Going Too Deep
Not every problem requires first principles thinking. For routine decisions, analogy is faster and sufficient. Reserve first principles for high-stakes or stuck situations.

### 2. Mistaking Opinions for Fundamentals
"People want cheap products" is not a first principle — it's an observation that may not hold in all contexts. True fundamentals are closer to physics, math, or basic human needs.

### 3. Ignoring Practical Constraints
First principles thinking reveals what's possible in theory. But execution still requires capital, time, skills, and luck. A theoretically optimal solution that's impossible to execute isn't useful.

### 4. Analysis Paralysis
You can always go deeper. Know when your decomposition is "good enough" to act on. The goal is useful insight, not perfect knowledge.

### 5. Underestimating Convention
Sometimes "the way it's always been done" is actually optimized through centuries of trial and error. Chesterton's Fence: understand why a rule exists before removing it.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Cost Decomposition
Pick any product you use daily. Break down its cost:
- What are the raw materials and their costs?
- What's the manufacturing cost?
- What's the distribution/marketing cost?
- What's the margin?
- Where is there room for 10x improvement?

### Exercise 2: Career Decomposition
Answer without using any job titles:
- What value do I create?
- What specific skills produce that value?
- Who needs this value?
- What are ALL the ways to deliver this value?

### Exercise 3: Industry Challenge
Pick an industry (healthcare, education, real estate, etc.):
- What are 5 things "everyone knows" about this industry?
- Which of those are fundamental truths vs. conventions?
- What would this industry look like if built from scratch today?

### Exercise 4: Personal Belief Audit
Pick a strongly held belief:
- Why do I believe this?
- Where did this belief come from?
- What evidence supports it?
- What evidence contradicts it?
- What's the fundamental truth underneath?
